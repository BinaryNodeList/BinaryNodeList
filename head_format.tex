\section {File Header}
Every valid Binary Node List \musts have a valid header. The header is 16 
\keyword{byte}s long. Is is layed out as described in the table below.

\begin{table}[h!]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|p{10cm}|}
        \hline
        Offset & Length & Type & Description\\
        \hline
        \hex{00} & \hex{04} & \keyword{int} & \Musts be equal to \constant{MAGIC\_WORD}.\\\hline
        \hex{04} & \hex{04} & \keyword{int} & Version of Binary Node List this file was rendered with.
                                              \Shoulds be in the range of \constant{MIN\_VERSION} and 
                                              \constant{MAX\_VERSION}, both inclusive.\\\hline
        \hex{08} & \hex{04} & \keyword{int} & Number of nodes this Binary Node List has.
                                              \Musts be greater than zero.\\\hline
        \hex{0C} & \hex{04} & \keyword{int} & Reserved for later use. \Shoulds be zero.\\\hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Implementation Suggestions}
The programmer \shoulds read 16 bytes from the input stream to verify the file.
The magic word \musts be validated, and the file version \shoulds be within the
expected range. If the file version is out of range, the file \mays be read if
it is not critical for proper operation of the target program.
